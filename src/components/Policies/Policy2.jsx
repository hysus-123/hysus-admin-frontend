      <h3>Sandwich Policy</h3>
      <h4>Understanding the Sandwich Policy</h4>
      <p>The Sandwich Policy is applied when an employee chooses to take leave days directly preceding and following a public holiday or a weekly off, thereby extending their absence from work. In this arrangement, the days between the leave and the non-working day(s) are not compensated as paid time off.
To avoid getting stuck in the Sandwich Policy, either take leave before the week off or after the week off to enjoy the benefits of weekly or public holidays.</p>
      <p>For example, if an organization, like Manish, observes a weekly off only on Sundays and Manish takes leave on Saturday and Monday, mistakenly assuming Sunday as a part of the weekly off, this situation qualifies as a sandwich policy. In such cases, three days of leave balance would be deducted. In scenarios where there is no leave balance, all three days are considered unpaid.</p>
    </section>  

    <section>
      <h3>Weekly Off</h3>
      <p>How Many Working Days Are Required to Earn a Weekly Off?</p>
      <p>In a week, 4 full days (36 hours) of attendance are required to earn a weekly off. Hysus Week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.</p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <div>1. Monday: You work a full day.</div>
      <div>2. Tuesday: Another full day of work.</div>
      <div>3. Wednesday: Yet another full day.</div>
      <div>4. Thursday: Your fourth full day of work.</div>
      <div>5. Friday: Absent</div>
      <p>
      <div>Now, according to the policy, since you have completed four full days of work, From Monday to Thursday, you are eligible for a weekly off.</div>
      <div>The consideration for a half-day that we are offering is only on a monthly basis, not for weekly offs. There is no provision for taking a half-day to earn a weekly off.</div>
