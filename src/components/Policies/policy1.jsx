                            <h3>J. OPEN DOOR ENVIRONMENT</h3>
                            <p>The purpose of the Open-Door guideline is to implement the philosophy that employees should be encouraged to raise their work-related concerns informally with their immediate Supervisor and/or Department Director or with any other Supervisor of their choice. The Company will attempt to keep all such expressions of concern, investigation, and the terms of any resolution confidential and consistent with applicable public records and laws when possible, recognizing, however, that in the course of investigating and resolving the concerns, some dissemination of information to others may be necessary or otherwise appropriate.
                            </p>
                            <p>Employees are encouraged to raise work-related concerns with their immediate Supervisor and/or Department Director as soon as possible after the event that causes the concerns occurs. Alternatively, if you believe that your immediate Supervisor is not the appropriate person with whom to raise the concern, you may raise it with the General Manager, CEO, Head of HR or with any other member of Company that you choose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Employees are encouraged to pursue discussion of their work-related concerns with the Supervisor of their choice until the matter is fully resolved. It may not always be possible to achieve the result the employee wants, but if not, the Company will attempt, in each case, to explain why. The Company believes that employee concerns are best addressed through informal and open communication. No employee will be disciplined or otherwise penalized for raising a good-faith concern.

                            <p>The Company respects the privacy of its employees. Maintaining a correct and up-to-date personnel record is important because it enables the Company to reach each employee in case of any emergency and properly maintain each employee’s insurance and other benefits to compute each employee’s payroll deductions. Employees should notify Human Resources promptly and in writing of changes to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Address and telephone number; </li>
                                <li>Marital status (for insurance and tax purposes);</li>
                                <li>Name;</li>
                                <li>Beneficiary/Dependents listed in your insurance policy; </li>
                                <li>Emergency contact information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>An employee must use such online employee benefits enrollment system approved by the Company to make changes to life insurance beneficiary designations. In addition, if an employee would like to provide any documentation concerning the completion of any training or educational courses, those records will be included in an employee’s training record. </p>
                            <p>All documents stored in the personnel record by the Company will remain with the record indefinitely. Although State retention schedules may suggest a limited necessity for certain documents, it is our practice that no documents that have been properly placed in the record will be removed at any time, for any reason.

                            <h3>L.	PROBATIONARY PERIOD</h3>
                            <p>The Company recruits carefully and attempts to hire the best employee for each position. It is, however, to both the Company and the employee's advantage to have an initial period of employment in which the employee has time to appraise the Company and job content, and the Company has a similar opportunity to appraise the new employee's job performance. Thus, each new employee must satisfactorily complete a probationary period of six (6) months measured from his/ her initial date of employment. Prior to the end of the probationary period, the Supervisor, with the consent of the Department Head will recommend, in writing, retention of the employee. If a positive recommendation is not made (and this can be anytime during the six (6) month probationary period), the employee shall be terminated from employment with no rights of appeal, including the grievance procedure, career service, or any other recourses.
</p>
<div>It is the Company’s policy to conduct performance evaluations with employees on a monthly basis for the length of the probation as a means of fostering employee development and motivating employees to reach their potential. The objectives of the evaluation plan are:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>To motivate and guide employees toward greater self-development and improve performance by discussing significant strengths and areas needing improvement in a positive, constructive manner.
</li>
<li>
To provide a uniform means for Supervisors to assess the employees’ performance in relation to performance requirements.
</li>
<li>To provide a means for evaluating employee suitability for continuation of employment beyond the probationary period.
</li>
<li>To identify training resource needs and to provide a record of employee progress.
</li>
</ul>
<div>The performance of all employees is reviewed on a monthly basis during the six (6) months of probation. The program described herein applies to all employees.
</div>
<p>At the successful completion of the Six (6) months probationary period, if recommended by the Supervisor and approved by the Head of HR, the employee is made a regular employee and receives all applicable benefits of those regular employees. The successful completion of the probationary period, however, does not mean that the employee is guaranteed employment for any specific duration.

</p>
<p>During the course of an employee’s probationary period, said employee is free to leave the Company at any time for any reason to be recorded, and the Company reserves a similar right.

                            <h3>M. RESIGNATION POLICY</h3>
                            <div>In order for an employee to leave the employment in good standing, it is important that the employee give at least one (1) month advance notice of resignation. The Full & final Settlement paycheck for a voluntarily resignation or terminated employees will generally be made available on his or her  45 days next regular payday after their last day. This policy in no way constitutes a contract or guarantee for advanced notice of termination by the Company.

                            <h3>N.	RESPONSIBILITY AND CONDUCT</h3>
                            <div>Employees shall not work in a manner that willfully obstructs or hinders another employee from completing his or her assigned duties. Employees shall conduct themselves so that the safety of both themselves and their fellow workers is preserved. Personal problems between employees shall not be pursued at work.
</div>
<p>An employee must receive permission to leave their assigned work area (other than for lunch). The Supervisor shall be made aware of why the employee has gone, and how long they will be gone. Returning employees shall check in with the Supervisor. If a Supervisor will be leaving the work area for any extended period of time, he or she shall inform subordinates who to contact in case of emergency.
</p>
<p>As soon as possible, after an employee knows that it will be necessary for him/her to be relieved from duty, the employee shall notify his/her Supervisor and/or Department Director. Employees unable to report for work shall notify his/her Supervisor and/or Department Director as soon as soon as possible, not later than thirty (30) minutes after the beginning of the scheduled workday. If the employee is on shift work, the Supervisor should be notified at least one (1) hour before the shift begins. The employee must actually speak to his/her Supervisor and/or Department Director. If unable to reach his/her Supervisor and/or Department Director the employee must leave a detailed voice-mail message, to both the Supervisor and Department Director with a telephone number to be reached. Failure to notify your Supervisor and/or Department Director will result in disciplinary actions as well as being charged leave without pay for the absence and be subject to disciplinary actions. The employee shall further advise his/her Supervisor and/or Department Director as to the probable duration of his/her absence and any changes of the duration. Also, employees shall notify their Supervisor and/or Department Director when they are able to return to work.
</p>
<p>The Company phones are not to be used for personal telephone calls, except for emergencies, and employees will not receive personal visitors at work without permission from a Supervisor. Cell phone use (including calls, texting, social media and the many other applications available today) should be kept to a minimum and should not interfere with an employee’s responsibilities.
</p>
<p>Employees are responsible for checking the bulletin boards for employee information. An employee, who changes his or her address, telephone number, family status, etc., shall immediately report the changes to the HR Head. 
</p>
<p>The above stated rules are not all inclusive and employees are expected to contact their Supervisor if in doubt of what is expected of them. Failure to comply with these rules is grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

                            <p><strong>Policy -</strong> Employees are expected to observe certain high standards of job performance and good conduct.

</ul>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES:</strong>The Company reserves the right to proceed directly to serious discipline, including termination, for job performance deficiencies, misconduct or attendance deficiencies, even in the absence of prior disciplinary action, when company deems such action is appropriate based on the seriousness of the matter. In certain circumstances, depending on the seriousness of the allegations, the Company reserves the right to suspend an employee with or without pay until the Administrative Review Hearing is held and the outcome is determined.
</p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW HEARINGS: </strong>Any employees facing disciplinary action with the possibility of suspension, termination, or demotion will be offered an Administrative Review Hearing (48-hour notice) prior to the action being taken, except when extenuating circumstances exist as determined by the Company (i.e. emergency declarations). The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that employees are given a chance to submit any and all facts relative to the infraction for which disciplinary action being considered.</p>
<p>Following an Administrative Review Hearing, the General Manager & CEO will determine the severity of discipline imposed, taking into consideration any recommendations made by Supervisors, Directors and/or the Head of HR as well as taking into consideration the employee’s personnel records, including past disciplinary actions.

</p>
<p>If the General Manager & CEO agrees a termination is warranted, he/she will advise staff of the proceedings. The hearing outcome will state the reason for the recommended termination. Depending on the seriousness of the reasons, an employee may be suspended with or without pay until the Administrative Review hearing is held and the outcome is determined. If the employee is a bargaining unit member, the Union will be notified of the hearing and be given an opportunity to attend the Administrative Review Hearing.
</p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION THAT COULD BE IMPOSED: </strong><span></span>
The Company relies on its employees to perform their jobs in accordance with the highest standards of public service. Counseling, along with disciplinary actions, may sometimes be administered to let you know when and where you have failed to meet its standards. This is meant to be educational and not punitive in nature. However, the Company reserves the right to proceed directly to serious discipline, including termination, for job performance deficiencies, misconduct or attendance deficiencies, even in the absence of prior disciplinary action, when the Company deems such action is appropriate based on the seriousness of the matter.
</p>
<p><strong>WRITTEN WARNING: 
</strong>A written warning is given to an employee to recognize a violation of Company’s policy, rule, regulation, standards, practices or acts, which if repeated or continued, will subject the employee to a more severe disciplinary action. The warning should be noted in writing, a copy of the notation placed in the employee's personnel file, specifying the nature of the warning and the date given. If the employee is a member of the bargaining unit, the Union will receive a copy. (An Administrative Review Hearing is not necessary for a written warning.)</p>
<p><div><strong>WRITTEN REPRIMAND: </strong></div>A written reprimand constitutes formal action against an employee for more serious types of violations of Company’s rules or standards and rules of conduct, or where less stringent actions have not been successful in correcting a deficiency. The written reprimand must identify the offense or deficiency and the correction required.</p>
<p>A written reprimand can be used to impose restrictions on an employee, such as attendance, conduct or special procedures to be followed. Restrictions so imposed shall be reviewed periodically and may be removed, modified, or continued with a follow-up letter. A copy of the written reprimand should be placed in the employee's personnel record. If the employee is a member of the bargaining unit, the Union will receive a copy. (An Administrative Review Hearing is not necessary for a written reprimand.)
</p>
<p><div><strong>DEMOTION</strong></div>
When an employee's performance demonstrates that he lacks the ability necessary for a position, that employee may be demoted. In addition, an employee can be demoted for disciplinary reasons. Following an Administrative Review Hearing, the General Manager & CEO will take into consideration any recommendations made by Supervisors, Directors and/or the Head of HR as well as taking into consideration the employees personnel records, including past disciplinary actions.
</p>
<p><div><strong>SUSPENSION: </strong></div>An employee may be suspended with or without pay as a disciplinary action. Following an Administrative Review Hearing the General Manager & CEO will take into consideration any recommendations made by Supervisors, Directors and/or the Head of HR as well as taking into consideration the employees personnel records, including past disciplinary actions. If the General Manager & CEO agrees a suspension is warranted, he/she will advise staff of the proceedings. Depending on the seriousness of the reason(s), an employee can be suspended with or without pay until the Administrative Review hearing is held and the outcome is determined.</p>
<p><div><strong>TERMINATION:</strong></div>
<strong>Voluntary Termination: </strong> The Company will consider an employee to have voluntarily terminated his or her employment if an employee does any of the following, (An Administrative Review Hearing will not be held):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Elects to formally resign from the Company;</li>
    <li>Fails to return from an approved leave of absence on the date specified by the Company; or
</li>
<li>Fails to report for work without notice for seven consecutive days. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Involuntary Termination -</strong>An employee may be terminated involuntarily for reasons that may include poor job performance, misconduct, attendance or other violations of Company’s Standards of Employment and Rules of Conduct as set forth above. Following an Administrative Review Hearing the General Manager & CEO will take into consideration any recommendations made by Supervisors, Directors and/or the Head of HR as well as taking into consideration the employee’s personnel records, including past disciplinary actions. If the General Manager & CEO agrees a termination is warranted, he/she will advise staff of the proceedings. Depending on the seriousness of the reason(s), an employee can be suspended with or without pay until the Administrative Review hearing is held and the outcome is determined.
</p>
<p><strong>Termination Due to Reorganizations, Economics, or Lack of Work -</strong>From time to time, the Company may need to terminate an employee as a consequence of reorganizations, job eliminations, and economic downturns in business, or lack of work. The Company should consider such terminations necessary and will attempt to provide all affected employees with advance notice when practical or when required by law. Layoff benefits associated with such terminations, if any, will be as specified in any such notice.

</p>
<p><div><strong>INDICTMENTS, PROSECUTIONS, ARRESTS: </strong></div>It is the responsibility of the Company to maintain a proper work force. Employees who are arrested, indicted by a Grand Jury, or on whom information has been filed by a prosecuting official, may be given an Administrative Review Hearing to determine the effect said action has on his or her employment with the Company, which may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If an employee is temporarily suspended, pending adjudication of the charges, another Administrative Review Hearing will be held after adjudication of the charges to determine whether to reinstate the employee based on review of the underlying facts, regardless of the outcome of the criminal case. In any case, where an employee is temporarily suspended pending adjudication, the Company shall not be precluded from conducting another Administrative Review Hearing and changing that temporary suspension to some other discipline, including termination prior to adjudication.</p>
